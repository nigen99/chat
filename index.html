 <h1>I'm kinda tired of finding out everything. If you find anything just tell me. I'm so sleepy rn.
  <h3>Please allow popups on this page to launch Interstellar.</h3>
   This cloaks your tab so the teachers can't see it on netref. It also hides it from your history. It will work as long as you allow popups.
   If your interested on how this works or anything about it really, just come and talk to me.
